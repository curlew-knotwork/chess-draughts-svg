# STATUS

- not finished yet

# NOTES

Checkerboards
- 8x8 and 10x10 checker boards from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:8x8_checkered_board_.svg and https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:10x10_checkered_board.svg
- 8x8 Chess board and pieces.
- 10x10 Draughts board and pieces.

Inkscape
- All board pieces drawn by hand using Inkscape
- Lasercutting: "hairline" width stroke is for vector burning; its color isn't important but I tried to make those red so to be more obvious to the eye. And to use black for raster etching.

Boxes.py
- boxes.py used to design the outline the two-piece game box. See https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de/TwoPiece.
